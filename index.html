        <h3>DALLA DALLA</h3>
          <p> People look at me, and they tell me /
          They look at my looks alone and say I'm a punk (No, no) /
          So what? I don't care /
          I'm sorry I don't care, don't care, really don't care (Be-be-be-because) /
          I don't care for love (Hey!) /
          There's much more fun out there in the world (Hey!) /
          Sisters tell me I still have a long way to become mature /
          (I'm sorry, sorry) I don't want to be mature</p>
        <h3>ICY</h3>
         <p> What can I do though I seem cold? /
          I don't care what you think because I'm cool oh, oh, oh /
          Come on /
          With confidence let it go (Here we go) /
          Marching on the streets (On a roll) /
          Background music where I be /
          (Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb) /
          Icy but I'm on fire /
          A dream inside me, I'm confident /
          Look at me, I'm not a liar /
          I don't want to be put in your box / </p>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTowEKjDGkU"> This is the real deal.</a>
        <h3>WANNABE</h3>
          <p>Stop with the nagging, I'll take care of it /
          No matter what I become /
          I'll take care of it /
          I do what I wanna /
          Whether I live a normal life or not, just leave it to me /
          I'll live my own life, because this life is mine /
          I'm so bad bad, I just wanna be selfish /
          It's a hundred times better than being hurt pretending to be nice /
          I'm just on my way, don't meddle in /
          I might just tell you to be better youself /</p>
